This repository contains all my coursework and labs from my online business analytics bootcamp provided by Duke University. 

20itemchecklist.pdf - This file is a 20 item check list of Business Metrics for data-driven companies.

File 2 - In this excel file, I calculated the Discrete Annual Compound interest rate for 10 years at an interest rate of 7%. I did this by using a relative reference and an absolute reference =B6*(1+$C$3). I then created a straight marked scatter for visualization to accompany the data. 

File 3 - Egger's Roast Coffee is an excel file which we used as a case study. It contains a Profit & Loss (P&L) statement as well as a Cash Flow statment to illustrate the critical differences between profitability metrics and cash flow metrics. 

File 4 - This file contained data downloaded from Yahoo Finance. It contains 176 months worth of data about the returns of the S&P 500 Index and Duke Energy Stock. We then calculated the continuously compounded or log monthly return. I then calculated the average monthly return, average annual return, standard deviation of monthly returns and annualized standard deviation of monthly returns. We then calculated the slope, y-intercept, correlation and r-squared values. Finally, we added a Marked Scatter Plot and added a linear trendline. Then we displayed the equation on the chart as well as the R-squared value.
