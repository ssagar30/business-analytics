This repository contains all my coursework and labs from my online business analytics bootcamp provided by Duke University. 

Lab 1 - Egger's Roast Coffee is an excel file which we used as a case study. It contains a Profit & Loss (P&L) statement as well as a Cash Flow statment to illustrate the critical differences between profitability metrics and cash flow metrics. 

File 2 - This file is a 20 item check list of Business Metrics for data-driven companies.
